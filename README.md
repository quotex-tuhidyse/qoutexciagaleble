-   provide a color scan copy of the first spread of the Client's
    passport (passport page with photo)
-   identify with the help of a "selfie" (photograph of himself)
-   confirm the address of registration (residence) of the Client, etc

The Company may request any documents if it is not possible to fully
identify the Client and the data entered by him.
